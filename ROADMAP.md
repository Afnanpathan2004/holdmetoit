## 0. Status vs Timeline (as of 2026-10-06)

### 0.1 Planned vs Actual

`FEATURES.md` §1 sets target windows per phase. Projected from the project start on 2026-09-05:

| Phase                   | Planned Window | Planned Dates   | Actual Status                                                                     | Variance                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------: | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `[P0]` MVP Core         |    ~10 days    | 09-05 → ~09-15  | ⚠️ ~65% feature parity; Gate 1 not passed                                         | **~3 weeks late**               |
| `[P1]` Automation & Bot |    2 weeks     | ~09-15 → ~09-29 | ⏸️ Not started (timestamp-derived status is a partial step toward `FEAT-CHAL-03`) | **~1 week past planned finish** |
| `[V1]` Gamification     |   2–3 weeks    | ~09-29 → ~10-20 | ⏸️ Not started                                                                    | Should be in progress           |
| `[V2]` Duels & Scale    |    2 weeks     | ~10-20 → ~11-03 | ⏸️ Not started                                                                    | —                               |

### 0.2 Actual Delivery History

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S1["Sprint 1: 09-05 to 09-08<br/>21 commits<br/>Core P0 built"] --> GAP["Dormant: 09-09 to 10-02<br/>0 commits"]
    GAP --> S2["Sprint 2: 10-03 to 10-06<br/>23 commits<br/>Obsidian UI overhaul, tasks, feedback, offline sync"]
    S2 --> NOW["Now: 10-06<br/>P0 hardening needed"]
```

- **Sprint 1 (09-05 → 09-08):** Scaffolding, domain math, Discord OAuth, cockpit, scoreboard, and admin ops. This delivered nearly all P0 features in cozy-café styling.
- **Sprint 2 (10-03 → 10-06):** Moved to the Obsidian design (Figma) and consolidated `/dashboard` into `/`. Status became timestamp-derived. `WeeklyGoal` was replaced by user-scoped Daily/Weekly tasks with offline sync and drag & drop. Also added: feedback system, LogRocket, Supabase image uploads, the manual weekly leaderboard, and the `DEV` role. **Side effect:** the UIs for the override grid, pardons, Discord summary, Punishment Wall, and PFP download were removed and haven't been rebuilt.

### 0.3 P0 Features Blocking Gate 1

| Blocker                                                                                  | Feature IDs                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| No UI for host override, pardon, or Discord summary copy                                 | `FEAT-LOG-04`, `FEAT-PUN-04`, `FEAT-DISC-01`  |
| No Punishment Wall or PFP download                                                       | `FEAT-PUN-02`, `FEAT-PUN-03`                  |
| Lock fails after natural expiry, so punishments are never evaluated                      | `FEAT-CHAL-05`, `FEAT-PUN-01`                 |
| Audit trail not persisted (in-memory)                                                    | `FEAT-AUDIT-01`                               |
| Goals decoupled from challenges, so Law L6 runs on hours only (product decision pending) | `FEAT-DECL-02`, `FEAT-DECL-04`, `FEAT-PUN-01` |
| Duo self-naming not implemented                                                          | `FEAT-CHAL-06`                                |
| Migration drift (`feedbacks`, `sort_order` not in migrations)                            | Deployment readiness                          |

### 0.4 Recommended Re-Plan

1. **P0 Hardening (~4–5 days):** fix finalization and the persisted audit log first, then rebuild the 5 missing admin/public UIs, decide on goals/L6, and repair the migrations.
2. **Gate 1:** deploy to Vercel and run one live pilot challenge with a shadow sheet.
3. **P1 (2 weeks):** YPT ingestion (`FEAT-LOG-03`) → automated expiry plus punishment evaluation (`FEAT-CHAL-03`) → bot (`FEAT-DISC-02/03`).

## 3. Phase 0 (MVP Core): The Spreadsheet Exorcism

### 3.1 Strategic Objective

Eradicate manual host labor. Deliver a robust, reliable web application capable of running a full community study battle from kickoff to punishment resolution with zero reliance on Google Sheets.

### 3.2 Core Capabilities

1. **Discord OAuth Authentication:** One-click login; automatic avatar and display name sync; fallback spectator mode.
2. **Multi-Format Challenge Creator:** Host-configured battles supporting dynamic per-event themes for `TEAM_VS_TEAM` (e.g. _Honey Bees vs Lavender Butterflies_, _Owls vs Larks_, _Matcha vs Espresso_), `DUOS` ($N=2$ with pre-kickoff participant duo self-naming), and `SOLOS` ($N=1$).
3. **Pre-Event Declarations:** Mandatory submission of weekly target hours (`HH:MM:SS`) and weekly to-do list tasks; strict lock invariant once the challenge goes `ACTIVE`.
4. **Clock-Time Self-Logging:** Daily hours entry in `HH:MM:SS` format with a 24-hour single-day safety limit.
5. **Head-to-Head Live Scoreboard:** Team totals, current leader, lead margin delta, and unified participant leaderboard.
6. **Dynamic Deficit Tracker:** Real-time catch-up pace indicator showing exact hours/day needed over remaining days.
7. **Dual-Failure Auto-Punishment:** Auto-flags participants who fail their hours target OR leave declared tasks unfinished.
8. **Direct Punishment PFP Download:** Instant one-click download of the punishment asset directly from the web app.
9. **Admin Manual Override Grid:** Host inline-edit capability to adjust any participant's logged hours or unlock tasks in case of emergency.
10.   **1-Click Discord Summary Generator:** Formatted markdown text generator ready to copy-paste into `#study-announcements`.

### 3.3 Database Entities at Phase 0 (as implemented in `prisma/schema.prisma`)

- `User` (Discord identity; role `PARTICIPANT` / `ADMIN` / `DEV`) + Auth.js `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken`
- `Challenge` (title, `startAt`/`endAt`, format, `eventBannerUrl`, `punishmentPfpUrl`, `challengeColor`). **No status column:** `UPCOMING`/`ACTIVE`/`COMPLETED` is derived from timestamps in `challenge-lifecycle.ts`
- `Team` (name, color, emoji, mascot, `maxMembers`, `sortOrder`) + `TeamMember`
- `ChallengeParticipant` (target seconds, optional team, status `NORMAL`/`DEFICIT`/`EXCUSED`/`PUNISHED`)
- `DailyStudyLog` (date, duration seconds, `isOverride`, `overrideById`, `overrideReason`)
- `PunishmentRecord` (punished flag, deficit seconds, incomplete goals count, pardon fields)
- `Category` + `Task` (**user-scoped** Daily/Weekly to-dos with `sortOrder`; replaced `WeeklyGoal` on 2026-10-04 and aren't linked to challenges)
- `LeaderboardEntry` (manual weekly slot hours, `Decimal(6,2)`: Law L8 deviation)
- `Feedback` (bug/enhancement reports with Discord delivery status)
- ⚠️ **Missing vs spec:** `AuditLog` (the audit trail is in-memory only)

### 3.4 Phase 0 Milestone Gate (Promotion to P1)

- [ ] Successful deployment to staging/production on Vercel. _(Builds cleanly; deployment not recorded in the repo.)_
- [ ] 100% test coverage on domain calculation formulas (`HH:MM:SS` parsing, deficit pacing, punishment evaluation). _(Domain suites exist and 559 tests pass as of 2026-10-06, but coverage % isn't measured yet; add `vitest run --coverage`.)_
- [ ] All P0 features usable end-to-end in the UI. _(5 admin/public UIs missing; see §0.3.)_
- [ ] **Live Pilot Challenge:** Run 1 full community challenge with real users, using a shadow Google Sheet as a fallback safety net to verify zero calculation divergence.

---

## 4. Phase 1 (P1): Automation & Integrations

### 4.1 Strategic Objective

Eliminate manual self-logging friction by connecting an automated YPT data ingestion bridge, deploying an interactive Discord bot, and automating event lifecycle transitions.

### 4.2 Core Capabilities

#### 4.2.1 Direct YPT API Bot Ingestion Engine

- **Context:** An independent YPT scraper/bot built by a teammate streams verified study times directly to HoldMeToIt.
- **Ingestion Route (`POST /api/v1/ingest/ypt`):**
   - Authenticated via secure pre-shared Bearer API Token.
   - Payload Schema:
      ```json
      {
         "discordId": "3141592653589793",
         "challengeId": "clx...",
         "date": "2026-09-08",
         "durationSeconds": 16200,
         "yptSubject": "Mathematics"
      }
      ```
   - Upserts atomic `DailyStudyLog` records and triggers immediate recalculation of team scores and individual pace.
- **Resilience:** If the scraper experiences network hiccups or YPT session expiration, the system allows participants to self-log manually on the web as a fallback.

#### 4.2.2 24/7 `@HoldMeToItBot` Discord Bot

- **Slash Commands:**
   - `/stats [user]` — Returns rich Discord embed showing user's daily hours, weekly target progress, and goal checklist.
   - `/standings` — Returns current team scores, lead delta, and individual top 3 podium.
   - `/deficit` — Displays remaining hours and required daily pace to stay out of the punishment bracket.
- **Scheduled Automated Broadcasts:**
   - Mid-day check-in embed automatically posted to `#study-announcements`.
   - Final results announcement embed automatically dispatched when the event concludes.

#### 4.2.3 Event Timer & Automated Countdown Expiration

- **Host Manual Kickoff:** Hosts retain explicit control over when an event starts to ensure rosters are finalized.
- **Automated Expiration:** Once the end timestamp expires:
   - System flips challenge status: `ACTIVE → COMPLETED`.
   - Freezes all logging forms and inputs immediately.
   - Executes the punishment evaluation routine and updates the Punishment Wall.

### 4.3 Database Schema Additions (P1)

- `ApiKey` (stores hashed tokens for teammate YPT bot authorization)
- `BotBroadcastLog` (audit records of automated Discord channel embeds sent)

### 4.4 Phase 1 Milestone Gate (Promotion to V1)

- [ ] Continuous 7-day automated YPT data ingestion without dropouts or duplicate entries.
- [ ] `@HoldMeToItBot` responds to slash commands with latency $<800\text{ms}$.
- [ ] Challenge auto-completes and accurately flags punishments without host intervention.

## 5. Phase 2 (V1): Gamification, Retention & Fair Balancing

### 5.1 Strategic Objective

Introduce advanced competitive fairness mechanics, prevent single-player carry imbalance, reward consistency through daily streaks, and cultivate long-term community pride through member profiles and achievement badges.

### 5.2 Core Capabilities

#### 5.2.1 Overflow Hours & Diminishing Returns Engine

- **The Problem:** In team battles, one participant studying 16 hours/day when they committed to 4 hours/day creates massive score distortion, demoralizing the competing team.
- **The Solution:** Dual-Credit Scoring Architecture:
   1. **Personal Profile & Badges:** The grinder receives **100% full credit** for all logged hours. No hard effort is ever discarded or demeaned.
   2. **Team Battle Match Score:** Hours beyond the declared daily commitment apply a damping factor ($\alpha = 0.50$) to preserve balanced team competition.
- **Piecewise Mathematical Formula:**
  For a day with declared daily target $T_{\text{daily}} = T_{\text{weekly}} / 7$ and logged time $L$:
  $$\text{TeamScore}_{\text{day}} = \begin{cases} L & \text{if } L \le T_{\text{daily}} \\ T_{\text{daily}} + 0.50 \times (L - T_{\text{daily}}) & \text{if } L > T_{\text{daily}} \end{cases}$$

#### 5.2.2 Auto-Balancer Snake Draft & 15-Hour Cap

- **15-Hour Daily Cap:** Declared targets cannot exceed $15\text{ hours/day}$ ($105\text{ hours/week}$) to safeguard member well-being and prevent fraudulent claims.
- **Algorithmic Snake Draft:**
   - Calculates a composite expected capacity for each member:
     $$\text{Rating}_i = 0.6 \times \text{DeclaredDailyTarget}_i + 0.4 \times \text{HistoricalDailyAverage}_i$$
   - Sorts participants descending by $\text{Rating}_i$ and executes an alternating snake draft ($A, B, B, A, A, B\dots$) to produce rosters with nearly identical total projected hours.
   - **Host Override Workbench:** Interactive drag-and-drop roster editor allowing mods to swap participants before confirming the draft.

#### 5.2.3 Daily Challenge Streaks

- **Mechanic:** A participant's daily streak increments by 1 for every challenge day where logged hours $\ge 100\%$ of their daily target pace.
- **Reset Invariant:** If an active challenge day ends with $0$ hours logged, the daily streak resets to $0$.

#### 5.2.4 Condition-Based Achievement Badges

| Badge | Title                | Condition Trigger                                                         |
| :---: | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  🏛️   | **Centurion**        | Accumulate $\ge 100\text{ hours}$ of verified lifetime study time.        |
|  🦉   | **Night Owl**        | Accumulate $\ge 30\text{ hours}$ between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.            |
|  🎯   | **Flawless Grinder** | Achieve $100\%$ of target hours AND $100\%$ of weekly goals in an event.  |
|  ⚡   | **Comeback Kid**     | Overcome a $>5\text{-hour}$ deficit in the final 48 hours to pass target. |
|  ⚔️   | **Veteran**          | Complete 5 community challenge seasons.                                   |

#### 5.2.5 Member Profile Cockpit (`/profile/[discordId]`)

- Total lifetime verified study time (`HH:MM:SS`).
- Team battle Win/Loss record.
- Current active daily streak.
- Unlocked achievement badges showcase.
- **Hall of Accountability Archive:** Public tally of successful completions vs times assigned the Punishment PFP.

### 5.3 Database Schema Additions (V1)

- `UserBadge` (relation linking `User` to `BadgeDefinition` with earned timestamp)
- `StreakRecord` (current streak, longest streak, last increment date)
- `HistoricalSeasonRecord` (archived snapshot of past battle placements and stats)

### 5.4 Phase 2 Milestone Gate (Promotion to V2)

- [ ] Diminishing returns formula mathematically verified across $50+$ simulated battle scenarios.
- [ ] Auto-balancer produces rosters with $<5\%$ delta in projected team capacity.
- [ ] Profile pages render dynamic user statistics in $<300\text{ms}$.

## 6. Phase 3 (V2): Spontaneous Duels & Scale Readiness

### 6.1 Strategic Objective

Empower community members to challenge friends to quick study sprints on demand without moderator overhead, while establishing multi-tenant database isolation to allow other Discord communities to onboard.

### 6.2 Core Capabilities

#### 6.2.1 Spontaneous 1v1 Mutual Study Sprint Duels

- **Concept:** Informal peer-to-peer study sprints (e.g. 1-hour, 2-hour, or single-day duels) initiated between two friends.
- **Lifecycle Flow:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       autonumber
       participant A as Member A
       participant Bot as "@HoldMeToItBot / Web"
       participant B as Member B
       participant Sys as Duel Engine
       A->>Bot: /duel challenge @MemberB duration:2h
       Bot->>B: Notification: "Member A challenged you to a 2h Study Duel!"
       B->>Bot: Accept Duel
       Bot->>Sys: Create temporary Duel Arena
       Sys->>Sys: Live Countdown & YPT sync
       Sys->>Bot: Timer Expired → Announce Winner
   ```
- **Zero Moderator Burden:** Sprints operate autonomously; no admin approval or management required.

#### 6.2.2 Multi-Guild Database Preparation

- Introduce optional `guild_id` foreign key relations across `Challenge`, `User`, and `Team`.
- Decouples community-specific configurations (e.g. punishment PFP assets, announcement channels), enabling HoldMeToIt to be added to external Discord servers.

### 6.3 Database Schema Additions (V2)

- `Duel` (initiator_id, opponent_id, duration_seconds, status, winner_id)
- `GuildConfig` (guild_id, announcement_channel_id, admin_role_id)

## 8. Technical Risk Management & Mitigations

| Risk                             |  Impact  | Likelihood | Technical Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------- | :------: | :--------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Teammate YPT Bot Downtime**    |   High   |   Medium   | Keep manual web self-logging fully functional as an active fallback. The system never blocks user input if the scraper drops. |
| **Discord Rate Limiting**        |  Medium  |    Low     | Queue channel announcements and bot responses; use webhooks with exponential backoff.                                         |
| **Extreme Outlier Skew**         |   High   |    High    | Addressed in Phase 2 via the 15h daily target cap and the 0.50 diminishing returns formula on team scores.                    |
| **Timer / Input Disputes**       |  Medium  |   Medium   | Mitigated via the Admin Manual Override Grid with `is_admin_override` audit logging.                                          |
| **Data Loss During Live Battle** | Critical |    Low     | Relational PostgreSQL persistence with atomic database transactions; daily backup snapshots on Supabase/Neon.                 |
