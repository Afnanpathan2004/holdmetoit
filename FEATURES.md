## 3. Module Specifications: Authentication & Identity

### §3.1 Discord OAuth 2.0 Authentication `[P0]`

- **User Flow:** User visits landing page $\rightarrow$ clicks "Login with Discord" $\rightarrow$ grants `identify` scope $\rightarrow$ redirected back with session.
- **Data Captured:** Discord Snowflake ID, username, global display name, avatar URL hash.
- **Persistence:** Upserts record into `User` table; synchronizes avatar and display name on every login.
- **Access Roles:**
   - `DEV`: Discord Snowflake in `DEV_DISCORD_IDS` (full development & host console privileges).
   - `ADMIN`: Evaluated dynamically via Discord Guild role IDs in `DISCORD_ADMIN_ROLE_IDS`.
   - `PARTICIPANT`: Default role for all enrolled community members.

### §3.2 Public Read-Only Spectator Mode `[P0]`

- **User Flow:** Anyone visiting `/challenge/:id` without an active session can view the live match scoreboard, participant hours, and download the punishment PFP.
- **Security Invariant:** Write actions (logging hours, checking goals, editing rosters) are disabled and hidden for unauthenticated guests.

### §3.3 Multi-Guild Tenant Isolation `[V2]`

- **Description:** Adds optional `guild_id` to `Challenge` and `User` models, preparing the codebase to be installed across multiple independent Discord communities without data leakage.

---

## 4. Module Specifications: Challenge Operations & Lifecycle

### §4.1 Multi-Format Challenge Creator & Dynamic Identities `[P0]`

- **Route:** `/admin/challenges/new`
- **Supported Formats:**
   1. `TEAM_VS_TEAM`: Two competing named rosters.
   2. `DUOS`: Pairs of $N=2$ accountability partners.
   3. `SOLOS`: Free-for-all individual leaderboard ($N=1$).
- **Dynamic Per-Event Team Themes:**
   - Team identities are never hardcoded across challenges. Every challenge defines its own thematic team names, icons/emojis, mascot illustrations, and accent colors (e.g. _Honey Bees vs Lavender Butterflies_, _Owls vs Larks_, _Matcha vs Espresso_, _Sunflowers vs Ferns_, _Dragons vs Griffins_).
   - Configurable during event creation via the host wizard and editable prior to kickoff.
- **Configuration Fields:** Title, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Format, Dynamic Team Names/Colors/Mascots, Participant Assignment, and two independent image uploads (both required for new challenges; PNG/JPEG/WebP, max 3 MB each):
   - **Event Header Image:** Stored as `eventBannerUrl` in the configured `event-banners` directory; supplies only the challenge hero and admin event-card thumbnails with wide cropping/readability overlays.
   - **Assigned Punishment PFP:** Stored as `punishmentPfpUrl` in the configured `punishment-pfps` directory in the same public bucket; supplies accountability avatar previews and downloads, never event headers.
   - Both can be replaced independently in Manage. Existing challenges retain their saved legacy values (including null) when editing unrelated details; changed image URLs must belong to their designated directory. Migration backfills legacy banners from the old image without changing PFPs or storage files.
   - Uploads provide loading, empty, and error/retry states. Cleanup after replacement/deletion checks references in both image fields across all challenges and retains shared files.

### §4.2 Host Manual Event Kickoff Trigger `[P0]`

- **Mechanism:** Even after the scheduled start time arrives, the host retains a "Start Event Now" button to verify all rosters and declared goals before locking inputs.
- **State Transition:** Advances `startAt` to current timestamp if in the future, deriving status `ACTIVE` via `calculateChallengeStatus`.

### §4.3 Automated Countdown Timer & Expiration `[P1]`

- **Mechanism:** Background scheduler checks active challenge end timestamps.
- **Automated Transition:** When the countdown hits `00:00:00`, challenge automatically transitions to `COMPLETED`, freezes logging forms, and executes the punishment calculation routine.

### §4.4 Auto-Balancer Snake Draft & 15-Hour Cap `[V1]`

- **15-Hour Sanity Cap:** System rejects any declared target $>15\text{ hours/day}$ ($>105\text{ hours/week}$).
- **Draft Algorithm:**
   - Calculates composite rating: $R_i = 0.6 \times \text{DeclaredTarget} + 0.4 \times \text{HistoricalDailyAverage}$.
   - Sorts participants and runs a snake draft ($A, B, B, A, A, B\dots$) to produce evenly matched teams.
   - **Host Override:** Drag-and-drop roster editor lets mods swap participants before launching.

### §4.5 Event Lock & Finalize Results `[P0]`

- **Route:** `/challenge/:id?tab=manage` (Manage tab)
- **Action:** Host clicks "Lock Final Results". Freezes all participant data rows and triggers the final punishment evaluation (`lockChallengeResultsAction`).
- **Lifecycle Invariant:** Dynamic status is derived via `calculateChallengeStatus(startAt, endAt)`. Note: A known defect currently prevents locking if the challenge natural end timestamp has already elapsed (`assertCanLockChallenge` rejects `COMPLETED`); a fix is prioritized to allow idempotent finalization post-expiry (`HANDOFF.md` D1).

### §4.6 Append-Only Immutable System Audit Trail `[P0]`

- **Feature ID:** `FEAT-AUDIT-01`
- **Description:** An immutable, tamper-proof audit log recording administrative actions, manual hours adjustments, pardons, and challenge kickoff/lock transitions.
- **Implementation Note:** Events are generated via `recordAuditEvent` in `features/audit/data/audit-log.repository.ts`. Currently held in-memory; persisting to a dedicated `AuditLog` database model and rendering the Host Console timeline UI is scheduled in `HANDOFF.md` D2/D3.

### §4.7 Duo Partner Self-Naming & Pre-Kickoff Locking `[P0]`

- **Feature ID:** `FEAT-CHAL-06`
- **Description:** In `DUOS` format events (pairs of $N=2$ accountability partners), team naming autonomy is granted directly to the participants forming each pair.
- **Rules & User Flow:**
   1. **Self-Naming Window (`UPCOMING` Phase):** When enrolled into a Duo slot during the pre-kickoff phase, either partner can input or edit their custom Duo Name (e.g., _"Caffeine & Calculus"_, _"Midnight Chai"_, _"Late-Night Bio Chemists"_).
   2. **Real-Time Synchronization:** When partner A updates the duo name, partner B sees the updated team badge immediately in their Cockpit and on the event roster.
   3. **Permanent Pre-Kickoff Lock:** Once the event host triggers kickoff (`ACTIVE`), duo team names become permanently read-only along with declared target hours and weekly goals.
   4. **Host Override Absolute (Law L5):** Community hosts retain administrative authority to rename offensive, disruptive, or duplicate duo names from `/admin/challenges/:id/roster` at any time, with all edits recorded in the audit trail (`FEAT-AUDIT-01`).

---

## 5. Module Specifications: Pre-Challenge Declarations

### §5.1 Declared Weekly Target Hours `[P0]`

- **Requirement:** Every enrolled participant enters their target hours in `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `35h 00m 00s`) during the `UPCOMING` phase.
- **Constraint:** Minimum $1\text{ hour}$, maximum $105\text{ hours}$ per week.

### §5.2 Weekly Goals & Tasks Architecture `[P0]`

- **Status & Decoupling:** In the current architecture (Session 30/33), tasks were decoupled from challenge enrollments into user-scoped Daily and Weekly categorized tasks (`FEAT-TASK-01` / `FEAT-TASK-02`).
- **Product Gate:** A product decision is pending (`HANDOFF.md` §4) on whether to re-introduce challenge-scoped goals or amend Law L6 to evaluate hours only.

### §5.3 Pre-Kickoff Declaration Lock `[P0]`

- **Invariant:** When the event status becomes `ACTIVE`, all participant target hours become permanently read-only. Late enrollments remain permitted while `ACTIVE`.

### §5.4 Host Target & Goal Administration `[P0]`

- **Purpose:** Accommodate real-life emergency adjustments.
- **Action:** Admins have backend repository methods (`updateParticipantTargetSeconds`) to adjust targets; UI integration into the Manage tab is scheduled.

---

## 6. Module Specifications: Study Hour Ingestion & Logging

### §6.1 Daily Clock-Time Self-Logging (`HH:MM:SS`) `[P0]`

- **Route:** `/` (Home Cockpit, replacing the legacy `/dashboard` route)
- **Input Fields:** Modal with relative challenge day selector ("Today" vs "Yesterday") with server-side UTC date resolution + three numeric inputs: `Hours`, `Minutes`, `Seconds`. Pre-fills existing log values when updating.
- **Display Representation:** Stored as total integer seconds, rendered formatted as `HH:MM:SS` (matching YPT display).

### §6.2 24-Hour Single-Day Limit Validation `[P0]`

- **Rule:** Total study time logged for any single participant on any single calendar date cannot exceed $86,400\text{ seconds}$ ($24\text{ hours}$).

### §6.3 Direct YPT API Bot Ingestion Endpoint `[P1]`

- **Route:** `POST /api/v1/ingest/ypt`
- **Authentication:** Pre-shared Bearer API Token between teammate's YPT bot and web server.
- **Payload:** `{ discordId, date, durationSeconds, yptSubject }`.
- **Behavior:** Automatically upserts `DailyStudyLog` records and recalculates standings without human effort.

### §6.4 Admin Inline Hours Override Grid `[P0]`

- **Location:** Manage tab (`/challenge/:id?tab=manage`)
- **Capability:** Action `adminOverrideStudyHoursAction` updates logs with `isOverride = true`, recording `overrideById` and reason. Rebuilding the inline grid UI inside the Manage tab is prioritized in `HANDOFF.md` D3.

---

## 7. Module Specifications: Standings, Scoreboard & Calculations

### §7.1 Head-to-Head Live Match Scoreboard `[P0]`

- **Layout:** High-contrast top banner displaying dynamic team identities (e.g. _Honey Bees vs Lavender Butterflies_, _Owls vs Larks_, or top contending Duo pairs in Duos mode).
- **Metrics:** Total cumulative time (`HH:MM:SS`), leader crown icon, split progress share percentage bar, and lead margin delta (`+Xh Ym Zs ahead`).

### §7.2 Unified Roster Standings Table `[P0]`

- **Columns:** Rank, Participant (Avatar + Discord Handle), Team Tag, Total Logged (`HH:MM:SS`), Today's Logged (`HH:MM:SS`), Target (`HH:MM:SS`), % Completed, Status Badge (`On Track` / `At Risk`).
- **Responsive Layout:** Automatically renders a multi-column table on desktop ($\ge 640\text{px}$) and converts into high-density stacked cards on mobile ($<640\text{px}$).

### §7.3 Dynamic Daily Catch-Up Deficit Engine `[P0]`

- **Formula:**
  $$\text{Deficit} = \max(0, \text{Target Seconds} - \text{Logged Seconds})$$
  $$\text{Required Pace / Day} = \frac{\text{Deficit}}{\text{Days Remaining}}$$

### §7.4 Overflow Diminishing Returns Scoring Engine `[V1]`

- **Problem Solved:** Prevents single extreme outliers from breaking team competitive balance.
- **Dual-Credit Invariant:**
   1. **Personal Profile / Badges:** Always awards **100% full credit** for all logged hours.
   2. **Team Match Score:** Hours beyond daily target apply a half-weight damping factor ($\alpha = 0.5$):
      $$\text{If } L \le T_{\text{daily}}: \quad \text{TeamScore} = L$$
      $$\text{If } L > T_{\text{daily}}: \quad \text{TeamScore} = T_{\text{daily}} + 0.5 \times (L - T_{\text{daily}})$$

   - **Daily Study History:** Full chronological timeline with one row per challenge day (Day 1..Day N), preserving zero-study rest days, second-level duration precision, cumulative durations, and subtle indicators for host/admin manual overrides.
   - **Progress Visualization:** Lightweight, accessible daily study bar chart.
   - **Team Metrics:** For team-based challenges, displays team rank, total house study hours, and participant contribution share percentage.

## 14. Deliberately Excluded / Rejected Features

The following features were evaluated and deliberately excluded based on user feedback:

- ❌ **Native In-Browser Study Timer (Pomodoro/Stopwatch):** Excluded because members study on diverse mobile devices where YPT is preferred.
- ❌ **In-App Virtual Study Rooms:** Excluded because community members already study inside Discord voice/video channels.
- ❌ **Automated Discord Role Assignments (Roles for Winners/Losers):** Excluded for now to avoid server role clutter.
- ❌ **Grace Passes / Freeze Days:** Excluded in favor of the pure cumulative catch-up deficit model.
