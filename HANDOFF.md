> **Removed routes:** `/dashboard` (replaced by `/`) and `/admin/challenges/[id]/roster` (replaced by the Manage tab). Several `revalidatePath("/dashboard")` calls remain and do nothing; they're harmless but should be cleaned up.

### 1.2 RBAC Model

- `DEV` → Discord snowflake listed in `DEV_DISCORD_IDS` (JSON array; legacy alias `DISCORD_DEV_IDS` still read).
- `ADMIN` → user holds a role in `DISCORD_ADMIN_ROLE_IDS` within `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` (looked up with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`; OAuth scope stays `identify`).
- `PARTICIPANT` → everyone else. The `DISCORD_ADMIN_IDS` whitelist has been removed.
- **Global Participant Preview:** Admins and devs can toggle a global cookie (`holdmetoit_preview_as_participant`) from the header next to "Admin Console". When active, all pages (`/`, `/challenge/[id]`, etc.) render exactly as regular participants see them (hiding Manage tab, Event Audit tab, host override controls, and DEV badge).

| `FEAT-CHAL-02`  | Host manual kickoff                |   ✅   | Manage tab → `kickoffChallengeAction` (sets `startAt = now`; status is derived from timestamps)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## 4. Open Product Decisions (Require Team Sign-off)

1. **Goals vs Law L6:** Should challenges get a challenge-scoped goal list again (e.g. link Weekly tasks to an enrollment), or should Law L6 be formally amended to hours-only? Until this is decided, `FEAT-DECL-02/04` and `FEAT-PUN-01` stay ⚠️.
2. **Leave days:** Should declared leave days reduce the target or the days remaining in the catch-up math? Law L3 forbids grace passes, so this needs an explicit ruling.
3. **Late enrollment while `ACTIVE`:** Is this intended? It's allowed today.
4. **Design authority:** `DESIGN.md` now documents the Obsidian system (it replaced "Cozy Study Café" on 2026-10-04). Confirm this is ratified.

## 6. Immediate Next Step (For Incoming Agent)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EXACT NEXT STEP (For Incoming Agent):**
>
> 1. Complete D3 UI restoration:
>    - Restore host pardon modal (`FEAT-PUN-04`) in the Manage tab with Obsidian styling.
>    - Restore 1-click Discord summary copy (`FEAT-DISC-01`) in the Manage tab with clipboard embed.
>    - Restore dedicated Punishment Wall view/modal (`FEAT-PUN-02`).
> 2. Reconcile remaining schema drift (D5): generate catch-up migrations for `feedbacks` and `categories`/`tasks` `sort_order` columns.

## 7. Session Changelog (Last 3–5 Sessions)

### Sessions 1–75 (Summarized)

- Core domain math, Prisma models, Discord OAuth, participant cockpit, mobile pass, drag & drop across Daily/Weekly boards, offline-first IndexedDB task sync (`holdmetoit_db`), 2-card participant logging, admin 7-day hours overrides, law labels UI cleanup, moderator future hours prevention, cross-day task moving/rescheduling with validation, participant study log audit trail integration (`STUDY_LOG_ADDED`), dedicated public challenges catalog (`/challenges`) with role-gated admin controls, multi-view pagination guards (`DataPagination`), challenge-specific participant statistics profiles (`/challenge/[id]/participant/[participantId]`), multi-view search & team filtering with "View by Team" mode, dynamic team color palettes with WCAG AA contrast calculation (`team-colors.ts`), overall time reset to 0 (`executeAdminResetOverallHours`), and challenge tab reload URL sync (`challenge-tabs.ts`). Also: full migration of daily study logs from legacy V1 to `DailyStudyLogV2` (cockpit/participant-stats log resolution simplified). Also (Session 76, afnan): leaderboard view-mode URL sync (`?view=individual|today|team`) with `popstate` restoration and participant-profile breadcrumb/empty-state context preservation.

### Session 77 — 2026-10-10 (afnan-jr)

- **Agent Role:** Participant UI Agent, Scoring & Engine Agent, Data & Identity Agent.
- **Punishment Picture Disclosure in Overview & About Tab Merge:**
   - **Domain Layer (`features/challenges/domain/challenge-tabs.ts`):**
      - Merged `"about"` into `"overview"`. Updated `CHALLENGE_TABS = ["overview", "leaderboard", "manage", "audit"]` and `PUBLIC_CHALLENGE_TABS = ["overview", "leaderboard"]`.
      - Added automatic fallback in `resolveAllowedChallengeTab` where `requestedTab === "about"` redirects safely to `"overview"`, preserving backwards compatibility with legacy bookmarks and external links without 404s.
      - Updated `challenge-tabs.test.ts` (10/10 tests green).
   - **Presentation Layer (`features/challenges/presentation/`):**
      - **Navigation Bar (`challenge-view.tsx`):** Removed the standalone "About" tab button and its rendering branch; tabs now cleanly present Overview, Leaderboard, and role-gated admin tabs.
      - **Timetable (UTC) Merge (`challenge-overview-tab.tsx`):** Integrated the challenge timetable (Kickoff and Conclusion timestamps formatted in UTC) and challenge description into the Welcome card on the Overview tab.
      - **Forfeit Avatar & Accountability Disclosure Card (`challenge-overview-tab.tsx`):** Added dedicated card for challenge forfeit preview with image preview and direct "Download Forfeit PFP" button.
   - **Server Page (`app/challenge/[id]/page.test.tsx`):**
      - Updated page server tests to assert that `searchParams.tab = "about"` resolves cleanly to `data-initial-tab="overview"`.
   - **Unit Tests:**
      - Added unit tests in `challenge-overview-tab.test.tsx` covering Timetable rendering, Punishment PFP preview + download button, null fallback state (8/8 tests green).
- **Quality Gates Verified:**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (75/75 test files passing, 788/788 tests green)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (10 routes compiled successfully)

### Session 78 — 2026-10-10 (afnan-jr + krish — merged `dev` into `main`)

- **Agent Role:** Admin Operations & Broadcaster Agent, Data & Identity Agent, Participant UI Agent, Scoring & Engine Agent.
- **Admin Roster Participant Removal (afnan-jr):**
   - **Repository (`features/challenges/data/challenge-admin.repository.ts`):** Added `removeChallengeParticipant`. Guards participant existence and blocks removal when the derived status is `COMPLETED` (allows `UPCOMING`/`ACTIVE`). Inside a transaction, deletes dependent rows explicitly in order — `dailyStudyLogV2` → `punishmentRecord` → `leaderboardEntry` (by `challengeId` + `userId`) → `teamMember` (by `userId` + `challengeId`) — then the `challengeParticipant`, and appends a `ROSTER_EDIT` audit event (previous roster state, `newValue: null`, required reason). The explicit deletes cover the `LeaderboardEntry`/`TeamMember` rows that do not cascade from `ChallengeParticipant`.
   - **Server Action (`features/challenges/api/challenge-admin.actions.ts`):** Added `removeChallengeParticipantAction` with a Zod schema (`challengeId`, `participantId`, `reason` min 3 chars), `requireAdminUser()` guard, scoreboard cache invalidation, and path revalidation.
   - **Presentation (`features/challenges/presentation/challenge-manage-tab.tsx`):** Added a destructive `UserMinus` control per roster row (hidden on `COMPLETED` challenges) and a confirmation modal requiring an audit reason, with success/error feedback. Removal is applied optimistically via local state (no `router.refresh()`), so the modal closes and only the removed row disappears instead of the whole route re-rendering.
   - **Test Suite:** Added repository tests (ordered deletes + audit, not-found, completed rejection) and action tests (success, short reason, non-admin), and extended the `challengeParticipant` Prisma mock with `delete`.
- **Participant Target Hours Override, Full Category DnD, Accessible Submit Button & Upstream Dev Merge (krish):**
   - **Option for Mods/Devs to Edit Weekly Goal Hours (`FEAT-DECL-04`, Issue #63):**
      - Added `"TARGET_HOURS_OVERRIDE"` to `AuditEventType` union and immutable audit logs.
      - Implemented `adminUpdateParticipantTarget` in `challenge-admin.repository.ts` and `adminUpdateParticipantTargetAction`.
      - Built `AdminTargetOverrideModal` (`admin-target-override-modal.tsx`) with Obsidian styling, `HH:MM:SS` duration inputs, quick hour presets (15h–60h), difference preview (fixed negative duration crash with `Math.abs`), and reason audit field.
      - Integrated "Edit target" buttons into Manage tab, Leaderboard tab, and Participant Stats profile.
   - **Dragging of To-Do Categories to Other Days (Issue #58):**
      - Added pure domain reordering functions `moveCategoryToDay`, `calculateReorderIndex`, and date helpers in `task-reorder.ts` with domain validation (forbids moving into past days).
      - Updated `cockpit-tasks-section.tsx`: category headers are draggable, child dragover propagation handled, day pill drag-over highlights, and IndexedDB sync.
   - **Reposition Submit & Action Buttons in Modal (Issue #52):**
      - Restructured `DailyHoursModal` actions so the primary submit button and leave toggle are directly accessible without scrolling on mobile viewports.
   - **Leave Visual Feedback & Profile Linkage (`FEAT-LOG-01`):**
      - Added `isLeave` column to `DailyStudyLog` / `DailyStudyLogV2` in Prisma schema.
      - Reflected leave badges (`🌴 On Leave`) across Home Cockpit banner, Participant Profile stats, and daily history charts.
- **Merge Integration:** Unified `dev` into `main`. The divergent `challenge-admin` repository/action/test conflicts were resolved by keeping **both** the roster-removal feature and the weekly target-hours override feature.
- **Quality Gates Verified:**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (76/76 test files passing, 825/825 tests green)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (11 routes compiled successfully)
- **NEXT STEP:** Fix D1 + D2 (challenge finalization after natural expiry & audit log persistence).

### Session 79 — 2026-10-10 (afnan-jr — PR #67 regression diagnosis, DB fix & re-land)

- **Agent Role:** Data & Identity Agent, Participant UI Agent.
- **Incident Diagnosis (PR #67 → PR #68 rollback):**
   - Root cause: `isLeave` was added to `prisma/schema.prisma` in PR #67 but never reached the database — no migration existed anywhere in history and `build` only runs `prisma generate`. The DB is push-managed (D5). Live introspection confirmed `"study_logs_v2"` was missing the column (while `"DailyStudyLog"` already had it from an earlier manual push).
   - Result: every Prisma query selecting/including `isLeave` threw `P2022` at request time. `app/page.tsx` silently caught it into `cockpit = null`, so enrolled users saw the unenrolled ENROLL banner; the participant profile page propagated the throw to the error boundary. Logging hours, the admin Manage tab, and Lock Final Results were broken by the same drift; the leaderboard kept working because its query uses an explicit `select` without `isLeave`.
   - Full diagnostic report: `~/.commandcode/plans/pr67-regression-diagnostic-report.md`.
- **Database Fix (`prisma/migrations/20261010120000_add_is_leave_to_study_logs`):**
   - Idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "isLeave" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` on both log tables; applied to the shared Supabase DB via `prisma db execute` and verified by re-introspection.
   - **Runbook:** DB column first, then deploy — additive columns are safe in both directions. Never run `migrate dev` against the drifted DB (reset risk).
- **PR #67 Re-land:** `git revert 62fd70a` (revert-of-revert). Do NOT re-land via a plain `dev` → `main` merge — `4cbcfb9` is already in main's history via `682cc90`, so a plain merge silently keeps the features reverted.
- **Error Surfacing (Law L9):**
   - `app/page.tsx`: removed the silent catch around `getParticipantCockpit` — errors now surface via `app/error.tsx` instead of faking the "not enrolled" state.
   - `app/challenge/[id]/participant/[participantId]/page.tsx`: guarded `generateMetadata` + page body; renders `ErrorState` + "Return to Leaderboard" on failure.
   - Added route-level `error.tsx` with LogRocket capture (partial ISSUES.md #10); regression tests added for both error paths.
- **CI Guard:** `scripts/check-schema-migration.sh` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fails any PR changing `prisma/schema.prisma` without a `prisma/migrations` change, and runs typecheck/test/build (repo previously had zero GitHub workflows; PR "checks" were Vercel builds only).
- **Quality Gates Verified:**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (76 files, 827/827 tests green)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (11 routes compiled successfully)
- **NEXT STEP:** Fix D1 + D2 (challenge finalization after natural expiry & audit log persistence); D5 catch-up migrations (`feedbacks`, `sort_order`) as the follow-up stretch.

### Session 80 — 2026-10-10 (afnan-jr — structured event logging & failure diagnostics)

- **Agent Role:** Observability / cross-cutting infrastructure.
- **Unified severity-filtered logger (`core/observability/`):**
   - Pure domain model (Law L7, zero framework imports, Vitest-covered): `domain/log-level.ts` (`LogLevel`, `parseLogLevel`, `shouldEmit`), `domain/log-entry.ts` (`buildLogEntry`, `serializeError`, `formatLogEntry`), `domain/log-events.ts` (typed `LogEventName` catalog).
   - `logger.ts` facade — `logEvent`, `logDebug/Info/Warn/Error`, `createLogger(scope)`. Server emits one-line JSON (captured by serverless logs); client logs to console and **dynamically** imports LogRocket to forward events (`track`) and errors (`captureException`, preserving `tags`). Every entry point is fail-safe (never throws).
   - Thresholds: server `LOG_LEVEL` (default `info` in prod / `debug` otherwise); client `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL` (default `warn` in prod / `debug` otherwise). `error` always emits.
- **Full event-surface instrumentation:**
   - All 24 server actions in `features/*/api/*.actions.ts`: success → `info` event, unexpected failures → `error` (serialized stack + context), expected control-flow errors (auth / access / not-found / conflict) → `debug`.
   - `app/api/tasks/sync` and `app/api/feedback` route handlers; Auth.js `events.signIn` (`auth.discord_signin`, `auth.user_synced`) and the previously swallowed role-sync `.catch` (`auth.role_sync_failed`, resolves ISSUES #7); the three error boundaries and three server pages now emit `app.error`.
- **Console exodus (ISSUES #16):** every app-runtime `console.*` (storage, audit repo, image cleanup, task-sync repo, client IndexedDB helper, boundaries, pages, routes) now routes through the logger; only the logger transport and `prisma/seed.ts` still call `console`. Removed the dead `captureLogRocketException` import in `cockpit-tasks-section.tsx`.
- **Env (ISSUES #17/#18):** `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGROCKET_APP_ID` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_RELEASE` now env-drive LogRocket (safe fallbacks); documented `LOG_LEVEL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGROCKET_APP_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_RELEASE` in `.env.example`. No new dependencies (stack stays LogRocket-only); no DB table or migration.
- **Tests:** added 14 unit tests (`core/observability/domain/*.test.ts`); updated 5 existing assertions that spied on old `console.*` output to assert on structured logger output.
- **Quality Gates Verified:**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (78 files, 841/841 tests green)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (11 routes compiled successfully)
- **NEXT STEP:** Fix D1 + D2 (challenge finalization after natural expiry & audit log persistence); D5 catch-up migrations (`feedbacks`, `sort_order`) as the follow-up stretch.

### Session 81 — 2026-10-10 (afnan-jr — consolidated dependabot dependency migration)

- **Agent Role:** Cross-cutting / dependency & toolchain maintenance.
- **Scope:** Folded five open dependabot PRs (#71–#75) into one branch (`afnan-jr`) instead of merging them individually, then performed the required migrations and fixed the resulting breakages.
   - #71 `source-map-js` 1.2.1 → 1.2.2 (transitive) — folded via lockfile.
   - #72 `brace-expansion` → 1.1.21 / 2.1.7 / 5.0.12 (GHSA DoS) — forced with `npm update` (plain `npm install` kept the vulnerable pins).
   - #73 `vitest` 3.2.7 → **5.0.3** (+ drops `tinypool`); #74 (vitest 4.1.11) dropped as the superseded major.
   - #75 `tailwindcss` 3.4.19 → **4.3.3** (+ drops `postcss-selector-parser`, `chokidar`/`braces`).
- **Toolchain migration:**
   - `vitest.config.ts`: replaced the deprecated `esbuild: { jsx: "automatic" }` (ignored by Vitest 5's Vite 8 / Rolldown) with `oxc: { jsx: { runtime: "automatic" } }`; normalized `test.exclude` to globs (`**/node_modules/**`, `**/.next/**`, `**/prototype/**`).
   - Tailwind v4: `postcss.config.mjs` now loads `@tailwindcss/postcss`; `app/globals.css` uses `@import "tailwindcss"; @config "../tailwind.config.ts";` (compat bridge keeps the JS design config + `tailwindcss-animate`); `tailwind.config.ts` `darkMode` normalized `["class"]` → `"class"` (v4 type) and `content` extended with `./core` + `./lib` (ISSUES #13).
   - **Node floor:** Vitest 5 requires Node `^22.12.0`; CI `node-version` bumped `20` → `22`, `engines.node: ">=22.12.0"` added, `packageManager: "npm@12.2.0"`.
   - Single lockfile: `bun.lock` deleted (ISSUES #11/D10); `package-lock.json` regenerated and verified with `npm ci`.
- **Verification (all gates green):**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (79 files, 844/844 tests green — no test-source changes required; the v5 mocker kept all `vi.mock` patterns working)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (11 routes compiled)
   - Built + dev CSS bundles inspected: `animate-in` / `--tw-enter-opacity` / `zoom-in-95` (tailwindcss-animate), `rounded-3xl`, `hsl(var(--border))`, and font vars all emitted; `/challenges` dev render returns HTTP 200.
   - `npm audit`: 20 → 8 advisories (ISSUES #5 resolved; remaining are Next 14 / `eslint-config-next` majors, out of scope).
- **Known warning (non-blocking):** Vite warns that `vitest.config.ts` uses ESM syntax while loaded as CommonJS — future Vite majors default to the native config loader, so rename to `vitest.config.mts` (or add `"type": "module"`) when that lands.
- **NEXT STEP:** Unchanged — Fix D1 + D2 (challenge finalization after natural expiry & audit log persistence); then D5 catch-up migrations (`feedbacks`, `sort_order`).

### Session 81 — 2026-10-11 (krish — Fix D1: Challenge Lock Results After Natural Expiry)

- **Agent Role:** Data & Identity Agent, Scoring & Engine Agent, Admin Operations & Broadcaster Agent.
- **Problem & Root Cause (D1, ISSUES.md #1, Issue #77):**
   - Challenge lifecycle status is derived dynamically via `calculateChallengeStatus(startAt, endAt)`. When a challenge naturally expired (`currentTime >= endTime`), its derived status immediately transitioned to `COMPLETED`.
   - `assertCanLockChallenge("COMPLETED")` threw `ChallengeStateError("Challenge results are already locked and finalized.")`, and the Manage tab button `Lock Final Results` was guarded by `challenge.status === "ACTIVE"`.
   - Result: if the host did not manually click "Lock Final Results" _before_ the timer expired, the challenge could never be locked, punishments were never evaluated, and Law L6 was broken for naturally ended events.
- **Implementation & Resolution:**
   - **Schema & Migration (`prisma/schema.prisma` & `prisma/migrations/20261011000000_add_results_locked_at_to_challenge/migration.sql`):**
      - Added `resultsLockedAt DateTime?` to `Challenge`.
      - Applied idempotent migration `ALTER TABLE "Challenge" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "resultsLockedAt" TIMESTAMP(3);` to Supabase DB via `prisma db execute`.
   - **Domain Lifecycle (`features/challenges/domain/challenge-lifecycle.ts`):**
      - Updated `canLockChallenge(statusOrChallenge, resultsLockedAt?)` and `assertCanLockChallenge(statusOrChallenge, resultsLockedAt?)` to allow locking when status is `COMPLETED` and `resultsLockedAt` is null/undefined.
      - Throws `ChallengeStateError("Challenge results are already locked and finalized.")` only when `resultsLockedAt != null`.
      - Exported `isChallengeResultsLocked`.
   - **Repository (`features/challenges/data/challenge-admin.repository.ts`):**
      - `lockChallengeResults` now passes `challenge.resultsLockedAt` into `assertCanLockChallenge`, updates `resultsLockedAt = now` in `tx.challenge.update`, and logs `resultsLockedAt` in the audit event.
   - **Presentation (`features/challenges/presentation/challenge-manage-tab.tsx` & `leaderboard-data.ts`):**
      - Added `resultsLockedAt` to `RawChallengePayload` and `ChallengeScoreboardViewModel`.
      - Manage tab now uses `canLockChallenge(challenge.status, challenge.resultsLockedAt)` to render "Lock Final Results" for both active challenges and expired unfinalized challenges.
      - Renders a clean "Results Locked" indicator once finalized.
   - **Test Suite Updates:**
      - Added domain lifecycle unit tests in `challenge-lifecycle.test.ts` for expired unfinalized challenges, already-locked rejections, and object inputs.
      - Added repository tests in `challenge-admin.repository.test.ts` asserting post-expiry lock evaluation, `resultsLockedAt` persistence, and idempotency protection.

### Session 82 — 2026-10-11 (krish — User Profile Navigation Links & Route Resolution)

- **Agent Role:** Participant UI Agent, Data & Identity Agent.
- **Scope & User Intent:**
   - Make the username displayed next to "Welcome" on the home cockpit dashboard and the user's name capsule in the top navigation header clickable.
   - Both links open the user's challenge participant statistics profile (`/challenge/[id]/participant/[participantId]`).
- **Implementation:**
   - **`/profile` Dynamic Resolution Route (`app/profile/page.tsx` & `page.test.tsx`):**
      - Created a dedicated `/profile` server component route.
      - Checks session; redirects unauthenticated visitors to `/`.
      - Inspects optional `?challengeId=` query param to prioritize participant profile lookup for that specific challenge.
      - Falls back to `findParticipantForUser(session.user.id)` to resolve the user's active, upcoming, or most recent challenge participant record.
      - Redirects to `/challenge/${participant.challengeId}/participant/${participant.id}`, or `/challenges` if the user has no enrollments.
   - **Top Navigation Bar Capsule (`features/auth/presentation/auth-nav.tsx` & `auth-nav.test.tsx`):**
      - Updated `UserNav` and `AppHeader` to support an optional `profileUrl` prop, defaulting to `/profile`.
      - Converted the user identity pill capsule into an accessible, interactive `<Link>` pointing to `profileUrl` with subtle Obsidian hover styling (`hover:bg-[#252525] hover:border-[#666666] group cursor-pointer`).
      - Updated `app/challenge/[id]/layout.tsx` to pass `/profile?challengeId=${params.id}` for contextual challenge navigation.
   - **Home Cockpit View (`features/study-logs/presentation/home-cockpit-view.tsx` & `home-cockpit-view.test.tsx`):**
      - Added optional `profileUrl` prop to `HomeCockpitViewProps`.
      - Computed `activeProfileUrl`: resolves directly to `/challenge/${cockpit.challengeId}/participant/${cockpit.participant.id}` when enrolled, or `/profile`.
      - Rendered the username next to "Welcome" as a clickable `<Link>` with hover underline and emerald green tint (`hover:underline hover:text-[#22c55e] transition-colors`) when authenticated.
   - **Home Page (`app/page.tsx`):**
      - Computes `profileUrl` from `cockpit` and passes it to both `<AppHeader>` and `<HomeCockpitView>`.
- **Quality Gates Verified:**
   - `npm run typecheck` ✅ (0 errors)
   - `npm run test` ✅ (80 test files, 858/858 tests green)
   - `npm run build` ✅ (12 routes compiled cleanly)
- **NEXT STEP:** Restore deleted P0 UIs (host pardon modal, 1-click Discord summary copy, Punishment Wall).
