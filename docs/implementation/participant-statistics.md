# Implementation Report — Challenge-Specific Participant Statistics & Read-Only Profiles

> **Feature ID:** `FEAT-LEAD-06`  
> **Route:** `/challenge/[id]/participant/[participantId]`  
> **Status:** ✅ Completed & Verified  
> **Date:** 2026-10-09

## 1. Overview

Implemented a challenge-specific participant statistics cockpit accessible by clicking any participant's name or avatar across the challenge views (Leaderboard podium, mobile cards, desktop standings table, Overview roster, and Admin manage roster).

The feature provides deep visibility into an enrolled scholar's study performance, pace, daily study records, house contributions, and accountability statuses while strictly preserving read-only access for participants and spectators.

## 2. Architecture & Components Reused

1. **Routing & Layout:**
   - Next.js 14 App Router under `app/challenge/[id]/participant/[participantId]/`.
   - Inherits `ChallengeLayout` (`AppHeader` + Obsidian dark canvas `#0d0d0d`).
   - Dynamic route parameters: `params.id` (challengeId) and `params.participantId`.
   - Dynamic metadata generation via `generateMetadata`.
   - Dedicated skeleton loader (`loading.tsx`).
   - Graceful empty/error states (`EmptyState` / `ErrorState`).

2. **Domain Layer (`features/participant-stats/domain/`):**
   - Pure TypeScript domain functions with zero framework dependencies (Law L7):
      - `calculateParticipantDailyTimeline`: Builds chronological timeline across all challenge days (Day 1..Day N), preserving zero-duration rest days (`00:00:00`), second-level precision, cumulative study totals, and manual override flags.
      - `calculateParticipantSummaryStats`: Safe division handling for goal completion percentage, total logged duration, today's logged duration, leaderboard rank, remaining duration, and target completion excess.
      - `calculateParticipantTeamStats`: Computes participant's percentage contribution to team hours and resolves house standings.
      - `calculateParticipantAccountability`: Evaluates remaining deficits, dynamic catch-up pace per remaining day, and pardon/forfeit badges.
   - Comprehensive test suite in `participant-stats.test.ts` (11 tests, 100% green).

3. **Data Access Layer (`features/participant-stats/data/`):**
   - `getChallengeParticipantStats`:
      - Queries participant, user, team, challenge, and daily study logs.
      - Enforces strict cross-challenge isolation: `participant.challengeId === challengeId`. Mismatched requests return `null` immediately.
      - Reuses authoritative `getChallengeScoreboard` to guarantee identical ranking, tie-breaking, and team aggregates.
   - Test suite in `participant-stats.repository.test.ts` (5 tests, 100% green).

4. **Presentation Layer (`features/participant-stats/presentation/`):**
   - `ParticipantProfileHeader`: Displays Discord avatar (with initials fallback), display name, `@username`, house badge, challenge rank pill, pace status, and breadcrumbs (`Challenges / [Challenge] / Leaderboard / [Participant]`).
   - `ParticipantSummaryCards`: 6 responsive cards for Total Study Time, Today's Hours, Target Hours, Completion %, Rank, and Remaining/Excess.
   - `ParticipantProgressChart`: Lightweight, responsive SVG/HTML bar chart of daily study duration with hover tooltips and accessible screen-reader table.
   - `ParticipantDailyHistory`: Full chronological table (desktop) and card list (mobile) with override indicators.
   - `ParticipantTeamStats`: Team standing, team total, and member contribution meter (omitted for `SOLOS`).
   - `ParticipantAccountability`: Target deficit, required catch-up pace per day, and pardon/forfeit badges.
   - Test suite in `participant-stats-view.test.tsx` (7 tests, 100% green).

5. **Navigation Entry Points:**
   - `features/leaderboard/presentation/challenge-leaderboard-tab.tsx`: Top 3 podium cards, mobile cards, desktop table rows.
   - `features/challenges/presentation/challenge-overview-tab.tsx`: Participant list.
   - `features/challenges/presentation/challenge-manage-tab.tsx`: Admin manage roster.

## 3. Read-Only Security & Authorization

- **Ordinary Participants & Spectators:**
   - Strictly read-only views with zero form inputs, text areas, or mutation buttons.
   - Sensitive account data (email, provider credentials, admin internal audit reasons) is excluded from the client view model.
- **Administrators & Hosts:**
   - View the same rich statistics. An "Admin Controls" link directs them to the Manage tab (`/challenge/[id]?tab=manage`) where authorized actions are validated server-side.
- **Cross-Challenge Isolation:**
   - Tested and verified: requesting a participant ID under an unrelated challenge returns 404 / empty state.

## 5. Known Limitations & Next Steps

- Challenge finalization (`FEAT-CHAL-05`) and audit log DB persistence (`FEAT-AUDIT-01`) remain the priority items for P0 hardening as tracked in `HANDOFF.md`.
