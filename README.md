# HoldMeToIt ⚡

> **Gamified Study Accountability & Challenge Management Platform**  
> Replacing manual Discord spreadsheets, YPT screenshot tracking, and host burnout with an automated challenge engine.

---

## 🎯 Overview & Mission

Study challenges in Discord communities (running weekly team accountability duels, productivity sprints, and study seasons) suffer from severe **Admin Burnout**. Community moderators spend 5–10 hours every week manually building complex spreadsheets, copy-pasting YPT daily timestamps across 20+ columns, calculating team hour differences, verifying individual to-do goals, and enforcing server Punishment PFPs.

**HoldMeToIt** automates the entire lifecycle of Discord study battles:

- **Instant Challenge Setup:** Hosts configure battle cycles (e.g. Tuesday–Monday), team rosters, and punishment rules in minutes.
- **Declared Individual Targets & Weekly Goals:** Each participant declares their own weekly study-hour target (e.g. 20h, 35h, 50h, 70h) and mandatory weekly goals in the pre-kickoff phase.
- **Clock-Time Self-Logging (`HH:MM:SS`):** Instant daily logging matching Yeolpumta (YPT) clock displays down to the second with a 24-hour daily safety limit.
- **The Catch-Up Deficit Engine:** Zero grace days. Missed hours dynamically roll over into remaining challenge days with real-time pace guidance.
- **Team vs Team Match Scoreboard:** Live head-to-head banner (e.g., _Bees vs Butterflies_), lead delta (`+Xh Ym Zs ahead`), and unified standings table.
- **Dual-Failure Accountability & Punishment PFP:** Automatic flagging if hours or goals fail, paired with a direct 1-click **Download Punishment PFP** button.
- **Discord Integration:** Frictionless Discord OAuth login with public read-only spectator mode and a 1-click formatted markdown summary copy generator for hosts.

## 📍 Project Status (2026-10-06)

- **Phase 0 (MVP Core):** ~65% feature parity. The core loop (login → enroll → log hours → live scoreboard → catch-up pace) works. Several host and accountability UIs still need rebuilding after the Obsidian redesign.
- **Quality gates:** typecheck ✅ · 559/559 tests ✅ · production build ✅
- See **[ROADMAP.md §0](ROADMAP.md)** for status vs timeline and **[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md)** for the verified feature matrix, defect list, and exact next step.

### 3. Database Setup and Local Development

Review [`prisma/migrations/README.md`](prisma/migrations/README.md) before applying migrations.

> [!WARNING]
> **Known schema drift:** the `feedbacks` table and the `sort_order` columns on `categories`/`tasks` were applied with `prisma db push` and have no migration files yet. On a fresh database, `prisma migrate deploy` alone produces an incomplete schema. Until catch-up migrations land (`HANDOFF.md` D5), run `npx prisma db push` on **fresh local dev databases only**.

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy   # apply migration history
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

Existing databases previously created with `db push` must be backed up and verified against the baseline before marking it applied (see the migration README). Don't run the baseline SQL against a populated database.

### 4. Verification (run before every PR)

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (delete a stale .next/ folder if it references removed routes)
npm run test        # vitest run
npm run build       # next build
```
